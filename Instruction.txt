IMPORTANT TO READ
You need to download latest python here https://www.python.org/downloads/ (I used Python 3.9.7)

Ignore this step if you download from https://bit.ly/YTDRelease A.K.A Releases (The zip one)
You need to download these module = pytime,pafy and youtube-dl (pip install pafy, pip install pytime, pip install youtube-dl)

How to use instruction!
1. Download and extract the zip on folder
2. Open Start.bat
3. Wait the program to load 
4. Paste youtube video link
5. Done you just need to wait until the download done

Note : 
Internet Speed is not restricted it depends on youtube/google server
If download was slow exit and run the program again if it still happening its youtube-dl problem
You can change the code freely as you want
